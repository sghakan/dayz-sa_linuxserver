# dayzsa_linuxserver

This Script is a fork of the <a href="https://linuxgsm.com">Linux Game Server Manager</a> and modified to run a DayZ Standalone 1.15 Exprimental Community Server!
It make use of tmux to seperate it from the user shell. It runs completely on the console so you can run it on a Root or V-Server with SSH access. 


# Currently working with DayZ Standalone v1.15 Experimental!
